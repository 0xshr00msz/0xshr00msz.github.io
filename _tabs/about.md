I'm 0xshr00msz, an Ethical Hacker at [Space - Cybersecurity Group Davao](https://www.facebook.com/spacecybergroup).

I am still a student at The [University of the Philippines - Mindanao](https://www.upmin.edu.ph), with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 

In my free time, I make websites, learn AWS, and participate in CTFs.
